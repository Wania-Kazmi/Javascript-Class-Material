Learning Basic JavaScript Schedule for Our Web 3.0 and Metaverse Classes:

We are holding three classes a week to teach you programming. Your onsite class, Monday Zoom/YouTube Class at 8:00 pm by Daniyal, and Saturday Zoom/YouTube Class at 8:00 pm by Hira Khan and Adil Altaf. 

All our COO's and Line Managers will also conduct help desk sessions. Please contact your section COO to get the schedule of help desk sessions.  

Please note that currently we have over 100 officers of Panaverse DAO appointed and ready to help you learn programming, but you will have to reach out and ask for help.

All our classes and help desk sessions we will follow this sequence:

1. Background of JavaScript and How to use JavaScript in Browser
